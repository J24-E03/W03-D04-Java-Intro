# Exercises

### Exercise 1: Odd or Even Checker
- Declare one integer: `int num1`.
- Check if the number is even or odd.
- Use `System.out.println()` to print `"The number " + number + " is odd"` if it's odd, and print the opposite if it's even.

### Exercise 2: Positive or Negative Checker
- Write a similar program to Exercise 1, but now check if the number is positive or negative.

### Exercise 3: Times Table
- Create a times table for a given number that prints the product for all numbers from 1 to 10.
- **Hint:** Use loops.

### Exercise 4: Factorial Calculation
- Write the Java code to calculate the factorial of a number using loops.

### BONUS: Addition Method
- Write a method that takes 2 numbers and adds them together.

### BONUS 2: FizzBuzz
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 50.
- For multiples of 3, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print `"Buzz"`.
- For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.

### BONUS 3: Grade Printer
- Given a variable `myGrade` which can be a number between 0 and 100, use `System.out.println()` to print the following:
  - 90-100 ---> A
  - 80-89 ---> B
  - 70-79 ---> C
  - 60-69 ---> D
  - Below 60 ---> F
